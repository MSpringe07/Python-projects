# Turtle Graphics Art

This Python script uses the turtle graphics library to draw a variety of shapes and patterns.

## Features

1. Draws a square, an octagon, a star, a spirograph, a pattern, and a house using turtle graphics.
2. Changes the color and width of the pen for different shapes.
3. Uses loops to draw repeated patterns.

## How to Run

You can run this script using Python 3. Make sure you have the `turtle` library installed. If not, you can install it using pip:

\`\`\`bash
pip install turtle
\`\`\`

Then, you can run the script:

\`\`\`bash
python script_name.py
\`\`\`

Replace `script_name.py` with the name of the script file.

## Output

The script opens a new window and draws the shapes and patterns in that window. The window remains open until it is manually closed.

## Note

The script uses the turtle graphics library, which is a standard library in Python, so it should be available in any standard Python environment. The turtle graphics library opens a new window for the drawing. Please make sure that your environment supports opening new windows.
