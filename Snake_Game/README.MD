# Snake Game

This Python script uses the turtle graphics library to create a simple snake game.

## Features

1. The game window is a square grid.
2. The snake is controlled using the keyboard arrows or the keys 'w', 'a', 's', 'd'.
3. The snake eats food that appears in random locations.
4. The game keeps track of the score and the high score, which are displayed on the screen.
5. The game ends when the snake collides with the border or with itself.

## How to Run

You can run this script using Python 3. Make sure you have the `turtle`, `random`, `time`, and `os` libraries installed. If not, you can install them using pip:

\`\`\`bash
pip install turtle
\`\`\`

Then, you can run the script:

\`\`\`bash
python script_name.py
\`\`\`

Replace `script_name.py` with the name of the script file.

## Output

The script opens a new window and starts the game. The window remains open until the game is over or it is manually closed.

## Note

The script uses the turtle graphics library, which is a standard library in Python, so it should be available in any standard Python environment. The turtle graphics library opens a new window for the game. Please make sure that your environment supports opening new windows.
