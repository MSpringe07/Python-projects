# JSON Data Manipulation

This Python script demonstrates various operations that can be performed on JSON data using the `json` library.

## Features

1. Converts a Python dictionary into a JSON string.
2. Converts a JSON string into a Python dictionary and retrieves a value.
3. Formats a Python dictionary into a pretty-printed JSON string.
4. Sorts the keys of a Python dictionary and writes the resulting JSON string to a file.
5. Parses a nested JSON string and retrieves a nested value.

## How to Run

You can run this script using Python 3. Make sure you have the `json` library installed. If not, you can install it using pip:

\`\`\`bash
pip install json
\`\`\`

Then, you can run the script:

\`\`\`bash
python script_name.py
\`\`\`

Replace `script_name.py` with the name of the script file.

## Output

The script prints the results of each operation. The results include JSON strings, retrieved values, and formatted JSON strings. The script also writes a sorted JSON string to a file named `sorted_data.json`.

## Note

The script uses the `json` library to perform operations on JSON data. The `json` library is a standard library in Python, so it should be available in any standard Python environment.
